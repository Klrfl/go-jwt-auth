# go-jwt-auth

This is a demo project for me to practice JWT auth with Go.

## Development

Things that needs to be installed on your machine:

- Go
- PostgreSQL

Install all deps with `go mod tidy`.

After cloning this repo and recovering the database at `go_jwt_auth.sql`, You can
edit the `.env.example` file and generate your own JWT secret.
